To guide you in finding the solution for the remaining questions, let's break down the tasks you need to accomplish without giving you the direct answers.

### Question #3
You need to display the current temperature in Celsius. Start by thinking about how you can convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the `getCelsius` function you already have. Consider what the current temperature in Fahrenheit might be and how you can use that to display the result.

### Question #4
This question likely involves manipulating the `message` element. Think about what kind of message you want to display. You might want to include some information about the weather or the city names you have in your `citynames` array. Consider how you can format this message and what content would be appropriate.

### Question #5
For this question, you might need to create a list or display the city names in a specific format. Think about how you can iterate over the `citynames` array and display each city name. You might want to use a loop or a method that allows you to join the names together in a readable format.

### Question #6
This question could involve some calculations or additional formatting. Consider what kind of data you have and how you might want to present it. You might need to use the `volume` variable or the city names in a meaningful way.

### Question #7
This question may require you to summarize or conclude the information you've displayed so far. Think about how you can wrap up the content you've created and what final message or information would be useful to the user.

By breaking down each question and considering what you need to do step by step, you should be able to find the solutions on your own. Good luck!
